### ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Network


This repository contains an implementation of AlexNet, a convolutional neural network architecture introduced in the paper ["ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf) by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton in 2012.

The implementation is built from scratch using PyTorch, without relying on high-level pre-built models. It serves as a learning tool and a base for further exploration of deep learning architectures.
