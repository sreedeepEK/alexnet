### ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Network


This repository is currently under development. I am working on a PyTorch implementation of the AlexNet architecture, as described in the paper [ImageNet Classification with Deep Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf).
